Honours Project: Developing & Testing a CNN based deepfake detection.
Dataset: DFDC Sample dataset (400 videos)


1. Pre-processing:
   -Cropped Faces & Landmark extraction (MTCNN)
   -Adjusting frame size & Augumentation
   -Splitting dataset into Trainig/Testing/Evaluation (70%/15%/15%)

2. CNN Detector
   -EfficientNet Based (pre-trained) (B0 because of small dataset)

Honours Project: Developing & Testing a CNN based deepfake detection. <br /> <br />
Dataset: DFDC Sample dataset (400 videos) <br />
<br />


1. Pre-processing: <br />
   -Cropped Faces & Landmark extraction (MTCNN) <br />
   -Adjusting frame size  <br />
   -Splitting dataset into Trainig/Testing/Evaluation (70%/15%/15%) <br />

2. CNN Detector <br />
   -Augumentation <br />
   -EfficientNet Based (pre-trained) (B0 because of small dataset) <br />

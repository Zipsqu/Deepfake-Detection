Honours Project: Developing & Testing a CNN based deepfake detection. <br /> <br />
Dataset: DFDC Sample dataset (400 videos) <br />
<br />



1. Pre-processing: <br />
   -Cropped Faces & Landmark extraction (MTCNN) <br />
   -Adjusting frame size (to 224x224 as required for EfficientNetB0)  <br />
   -Splitting dataset into Trainig/Testing/Evaluation (80%,10%,10%) <br /> 

2. CNN Detector <br />
   -Augumentation ( <br />
   -EfficientNetB0 Based (smallest EfficientNet) <br />
